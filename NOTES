* What about pooling???
** Should we do pooling with Zeek script?
** Do the implementation outside of C++.
** Blocking with when and timeout?

  when ( local c = pq_get_from_pool(pool) ) {
  }

* Using the same connection for two queries is invalid usage.
  * That's probably no different in other languages, but the
    asynchronous / when usage doesn't make it easy to avoid it.
  * Maybe pooling and careful usage is the answer?
  * How does JS solve this?


* Can specify synchronous_commit = 'off' at connection time in connection string
